# Introduction
The source code of the lecture is [here][https://github.com/StephenGrider/GoCasts).

# Setup
* Download GO package by clicking [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
    * If you have an old GO version installed (run `go version` to verify).
    * I took a dirty approach of uninstalling the previous version first and
      then installing the newer version. Proceed, if you'd like to do the same.
    * Find the GO installation $PATH, `which go`.
    * ``
    * ``
    * ``
    * ``

* To verify if GO is installed correctly or not, execute `go` in your terminal.
  You should see a list of GO supported commands.
